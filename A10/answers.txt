Answers for Evgeni (Eugene) Borissov for CMPT732.    

1. What happened to the HDFS file when one of the nodes it was stored on failed?

It waits some time (30s to 1min+), and makes a 3rd copy on the node that didn't previously have a copy (because it wants to store on 3 nodes).  The goal is to have 0 number of under-replicated blocks, and it will try to do this, if possible.


2. How did YARN/MapReduce behave when one of the compute nodes disappeared?

It exited the tasks on the failed node, saying "Exit status: -100". The tasks being performed on the failed node had to be restarted and performed by the other nodes.


3. Were there more things you'd like to try with this cluster, or anything you did try that you think should have been in this assignment?

This was a good assignment! I think it covered the key points of failure.
