Answers for Evgeni (Eugene) Borissov for CMPT732.    

1. What is your best guess for the slope and intercept of the streaming points being produced?

alpha = 45.6, beta = -51.3


2. Is your streaming program's estimate of the slope and intercept getting better as the program runs? (That is: is the program aggregating all of the data from the start of time, or only those that have arrived since the last output?)

Yes, it's aggregating.


3. In the colour classification question, what were your validation scores for the RGB and LAB pipelines?

R**2 of about 0.6 for RGB, and about 0.7 for LAB.


4. When predicting the tmax values, did you over-fit the training data (and for which training/validation sets)?

Features: R**2
"latitude", "longitude", "elevation": train = 0.87, validation = 0.83
"latitude", "longitude", "elevation", "day": train = 0.90, validation = 0.80
"latitude", "longitude", "elevation", "day", "tmax_yesterday": train = 0.94, validation = 0.91

Based on the difference between the R**2 of the training and validation sets, the model with features "latitude", "longitude", "elevation", "day" seems to overfit the data, but the other models don't overfit.


5. What were your testing scores for your model with and without the “yesterday's temperature” feature?

"latitude", "longitude", "elevation": train = 0.87, validation = 0.83
"latitude", "longitude", "elevation", "day": train = 0.90, validation = 0.80
"latitude", "longitude", "elevation", "day", "tmax_yesterday": train = 0.94, validation = 0.91


6. If you're using a tree-based model, you'll find a .featureImportances property that describes the relative importance of each feature (code commented out in weather_test.py; if not, skip this question). Have a look with and without the “yesterday's temperature” feature: do the results make sense and suggest that your model is making decisions reasonably? With “yesterday's temperature”, is it just predicting “same as yesterday”?

Features: "latitude", "longitude", "elevation", "day", "tmax_yesterday"
Without: [0.215168295123,0.129230731211,0.137567178184,0.518033795483]
With: [0.183944539358,0.0753665536851,0.0889253626327,0.172923646251,0.478839898073]

When adding yesterday's temperature, the impact of all features decreases, and about half of the prediction is based on yesterday's temperature; this seems reasonable because the maximum temperature usually doesn't change very much from day day to the next.
